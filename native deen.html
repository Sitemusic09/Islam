   <p class="Aq"> Native Deen is an Islamic musical group from the Washington, D.C. area. Native Deen's music combines hip hop and R&B styles with lyrical themes grounded in Islam. They have three albums: Deen You Know, Not Afraid To Stand Alone and The Remedy (Native Deen album).</p>
   <p class="Aq"> "Deen" in Arabic means "religion" or "way of life." Native Deen comprises Joshua Salaam, Naeem Muhammad, and Abdul-Malik Ahmad, young Muslim men who were born and raised in the District of Columbia. Their music seeks to inspire young people to keep their Islamic faith amidst the pressures and temptations of daily life. Group members identify themselves as Muslim, and wear traditional Islamic dress such as kufis and shalwar kameez. They say there is more than one way to identify as a Muslim, both by etiquette and dress. Their music typifies the subgenre "positive hip-hop".</p>
   <p class="Aq"> Native Deen performs at Islamic conferences, fundraisers, and holiday gatherings (often during Ramadan and Eid-ul-Adha). The group is relatively well-known among Muslim youth in North America, and has toured internationally.
   Native Deen's music typically features drums, synthesized instruments, and vocals. Due to the belief of the majority of the Islamic scholars on the matter, wind, string, and metal instruments are never used. </p>
